V1.5.5 July 8, 2025

3DCellComposer is a versatile, open-source software designed as a general solution for 3D cell segmentation. It allows users to choose an existing 2D segmentation model appropriate for their tissue or cell type(s) without requiring any additional training. Moreover, we have enhanced our CellSegmentationEvaluator quality evaluation tool to support 3D images. It allows users to compare and select the most suitable 2D segmentation models for 3D tasks, without the need for human annotations to assess performance.

It is available as a full-featured GitHub repository, and as a python package on PyPi that provides an older, simplified implementation that uses just DeepCell as the 2D segmenter.

Note that using a Linux/Unix/MacOS environment is recommended since execution on Windows systems is reported to be extremely slow.  This is because the GPU package does not work as distributed and therefore CPU processing is used.

Reference: Haoran Chen and Robert F. Murphy (2025) 3DCellComposer - A Versatile Pipeline Utilizing 2D Cell Segmentation Methods for 3D Cell Segmentation. Under review.

Changes in V1.3: Options added to support subsampling of the slices along each axis.  Caching of slice segmentation results to avoid segmenting again.  Fixes to image padding when the number of z slices is too small.

Changes in V1.5: Added options for cropping initial image, block-wise voxel downsampling prior to segmentation,- setting specific DeepCell parameters (including whether to segment using cell channel, nuclear channel or both), and controlling the minimum padding

Changes in V1.5.2: Improved installation instructions and update environment.yml and requirements.txt.  Updated Cellpose support. Removed use of pint package.

Changes in V1.5.3: Added --min_slices option for specifying the minimum number of slices that a candidate cells must have in order to be considered a matched cell.

Changes in V1.5.5: Added note regarding Windows processing times.

## Using the repository version

### Overview
The `3DCellComposer` script processes multiplexed imaging data for cell segmentation. It requires specific inputs including the path to the image file and lists of markers for different cell components (nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane). It currently can use DeepCell,  Cellpose or a user-provided method for 2D segmentation

### Installation

- Clone or download this GitHub repository.
- Install conda and pip, if not already installed.
- (Recommended) Create and activate an environment customized to 3DCellComposer.  DeepCell requires 'tensorflow' which currently is not supported for python versions greater than 3.12.  To create and activate conda environment that uses an earlier python version (you can skip the "python=3.9.13" if you a running a version before 3.13):
```bash
conda create --name 3DCellComposer python=3.9.13
conda activate 3DCellComposer
```
- Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

- The software was tested on Python 3.8 and 3.9 on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS and MacOS 14.7.4 and 14.7.6

- Note: If you are going to use DeepCell, it requires an access token that can be obtained at <https://users.deepcell.org/>.  The token needs to be added to your environment using 
```bash
export DEEPCELL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token_value>
```

### Most frequently used optional argument descriptions

**--skipYZ**
**Description**: Only do 2D segmentation on XY and XZ slices
**Format**: True or False
**Default** False

**--segmentation_method**
**Description**: Choose the 2D segmentation method.

**--min_slices**
**Description**: Sets the minimum number of z slices required for a candidate cell to be
        accepted as a 3D cell (cannot be less than 3 otherwise corresponding nucleus
        will be rejected as not being fully contained within the cell
**Format**: integer
**Default**: "4"

**--min_slice_padding**
**Description**: Sets the minimum width or height of slices used for segmentation;
        typically needed for XZ or YZ slices to meet DeepCell requirements;
        normally a power of two
**Format**: integer
**Default**: "512"

**--chunk_size**
**Description**: Specifies how often to report on slices segmented
**Format**: integer
**Default**: "100"

### Optional argument for balancing or reducing voxel dimensions

**--downsample_vector**
**Description**: Sets whether block-wise downsampling should be done before segmentation;
         e.g., if X,Y,Z voxel dimensions are 0.5,0.5,1 microns, perhaps use '2,2,1' so
        that voxels are cubic and all directions are equivalent; 
       resulting segmentation masks are upsampled to the original resolution before saving
**Format**: quoted list of 3 integers separated by commas in the order Z, Y, X
**Default**: "1,1,1"

### Optional arguments for reducing number of slices to segment

**--sampling_interval**
**Description**: Specifies how frequently to segment slices in XY, XZ and YZ directions
        (segmentations for slices that are skipped are duplicated using neighboring slices;
        goal is to reduce total computation time; sampling interval would normally be higher
        for directions with more slices which would normally be the XZ and YZ directions;
        e.g., if X,Y,Z voxel dimensions are 0.1,0.1,0.4 microns, perhaps use '1,4,4' so that
        slices are segmented less frequently in X)
**Format**: quoted list of 3 integers separated by commas in the order XY, XZ, YZ
**Default**: '1,1,1'

**--sampling_reduce**
**Description**: Divisor to reduce sampling_interval by and resentment if quality_threshold is not 
        reached; segmentations for previously segmented slices are kept and reused

**Description**: Stops decreasing sampling interval if quality score is greater than this value
**Format**: floating point number
**Default**: infinity

### Optional arguments for reducing compute time

**--JI_range**
**Description**: Change the range of values of the Jaccard index that are tried for optimizing detection of overlap between cells in adjacent 2D slices;
          more intervals mean more time in the "Matching 2D cells" phase
**Format**: quoted list of three floating point numbers (start,end,increment)
**Default**" "0.0,0.4,5"

**--skip_eval**
**Description: Sets whether to call CellSegmentationEvaluator for each JI value segmentation;
         setting to True may be useful to reduce compute time (e.g., when debugging)
**Format**: True or False
**Default**: False

**--skip_blender**
**Description: Sets whether to create Blender files for 3D visualization of final segmentation
         Setting to True may be useful to reduce compute time or if not needed
**Format**: True or False
**Default**: False

**--clear_cache**
**Description: 3DCellComposer saves intermediate files to save time when rerunning or resuming
         an interrupted run.  Setting this option to True deletes those files to start from
        scratch (necessary if significant changes in options are made)
**Format**: True or False
**Default**: False

### Optional arguments for optimizing 2D segmentation

**--maxima_threshold**
**Description**: Sets the corresponding DeepCell parameter (lower values favor more cells)
**Format**: floating point number
**Default**: 0.075 (which is the DeepCell default)

**--interior_threshold**
**Description**: Sets the corresponding DeepCell parameter (lower values favor fewer cells)
**Format**: floating point number
**Default**: 0.2

**--compartment**
**Description**: Sets the corresponding DeepCell parameter ("both", "whole-cell", "nuclear")
           (Used to ignore one of the input channels, if desired)
**Format**: string
**Default**: "both"


### Example Command
Here is an example of a complete command:

```bash
python run_3DCellComposer.py ./data/3D_IMC_image.ome.tiff "Ir191" "In115,Y89,Tb159" "La139,Pr141,Eu151,Gd160,Dy162" --segmentation_method "deepcell" --results_path "myresults"
```

Note that the example image file 3D_IMC_image.ome.tiff is too large to be stored with normal github.  It is therefore stored with git lfs which places a pointer to the actual file into the github repo.  

**The "run_examples.sh" gives example runs and the comments in the file describe ways to obtain the example image.**

In this command, the script processes the image located at `./data/3D_IMC_image.ome.tiff`, utilizing Ir191 as the nuclear marker, the sum of In115, Y89, Tb159 as the cytoplasmic markers, and the sum of La139, Pr141, Eu151, Gd160, Dy162 as the cell membrane markers. The script employs DeepCell as the 2D segmentation model, and the results are stored in the specified folder within the current folder.

## Using the PyPI package

To use the package, 
```bash
pip install ThreeDCellComposer
```

To call the function in python,
```bash
from ThreeDCellComposer.ThreeDCellComposer import ThreeDCellComposer

ThreeDCellComposer(image_path,nucleus_channel_marker_list,cytoplasm_channel_marker_list,membrane_channel_marker_list,segmentation_method)
```
where the channel lists are strings consisting of the names (not numbers) of the channels to be used for segmentation. Only 'deepcell' is supported as the segmentation_method by the PyPI package at this time. Additional optional arguments are described below.

'run_3DCellComposerUsingPackage.py' is an example python program that calls ThreeDCellComposer.  See also the script "run_examples.sh"
